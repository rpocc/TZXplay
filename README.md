TZXplay is a simple HTML5 + JS script which can be used as a web-based tape player, which allows loading ZX Spectrum cassette images in TZX format directly into existing ZX Spefctrum machine using your phone. Unfortunatelly this player is for some reason isn't supported in iOS. Will be happy if someone will fork the code or propose changes needed to get the player working in Apple phones as well.

Usage: Just download the folder locally or use via preview tool:
