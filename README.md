TZXplay is a simple HTML5 + JS script which can be used as a web-based online ZX Spectrum tape player, which allows loading ZX Spectrum cassette images in TZX format directly into existing ZX Spectrum machine using an audio output of your laptop, smartphone or a tablet. Unfortunately for some reason this player does not work in iOS. Will be happy if someone will fork the code to improve it or propose changes needed to get the player working in Apple phones as well.

Usage: Just download the folder locally or use online via preview tool:
